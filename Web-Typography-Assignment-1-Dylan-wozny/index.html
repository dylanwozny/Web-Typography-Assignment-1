      <h2>The Creation of a Classic</h2>
      <div class="clearfix">
      <p>
        <span class="bold">Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</span>  is a fantasy novel for children by
        C. S. Lewis, published by Geoffrey Bles in 1950. It is the first
        published and best known of seven novels in The Chronicles of Narnia
        (1950–1956). Among all the author's books, it is also the most widely
        held in libraries. Although it was originally the first of The
        Chronicles of Narnia, it is volume two in recent editions that are
        sequenced by the stories' chronology. Like the other Chronicles, it was
        illustrated by Pauline Baynes, and her work has been retained in many
        later editions.

        Most of the novel is set in Narnia, a land of talking animals and
        mythical creatures that is ruled by the evil White Witch. In the frame
        story, four English children are relocated to a large, old country house
        following a wartime evacuation. The youngest, Lucy, visits Narnia three
        times via the magic of a wardrobe in a spare room. Lucy's three siblings
        are with her on her third visit to Narnia. In Narnia, the siblings seem
        fit to fulfill an old prophecy and find themselves adventuring to save
        Narnia and their own lives. The lion Aslan gives his life to save one of
        the children; he later rises from the dead, vanquishes the White Witch,
        and crowns the children Kings and Queens of Narnia.

      <p >
        Lewis wrote the book for (and dedicated it to) his goddaughter, Lucy
        Barfield. She was the daughter of Owen Barfield, Lewis's friend,
        teacher, adviser, and trustee. In 2003, The Lion, the Witch and the
        Wardrobe was ranked ninth on the BBC’s The Big Read poll. Time magazine
        included the novel in its list of the 100 Best Young-Adult Books of All
        Time.

      <h2>Plot Summary</h2>
      
        <div class="clearfix">
          <p>
        <span class="bold"> Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy Pevensie</span> are evacuated from London during
        the Blitz and sent to live with an old professor (identified in a later
        book as Digory Kirke) in the English countryside. While exploring the
        professor's house, Lucy enters a wardrobe that leads her into a snowy
        wooded area with a lighted lamppost growing from the ground. Lucy meets
        Tumnus, a faun who befriends her and informs her that she is in the land
        of Narnia. Tumnus intends to send Lucy to the White Witch, a ruler who
        keeps Narnia frozen in a perpetual winter and who requires that any
        human found in Narnia be sent to her. Tumnus repents, however, and
        escorts Lucy back to the lamppost; once there, she returns to her own
        world by re-entering the wardrobe and finds that only a few seconds have
        passed there during her absence. None of her siblings believe her story
        about Narnia; upon inspection, the back of the wardrobe appears solid
        and leads nowhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lucy enters the wardrobe again, and it again leads her into Narnia. This
        time, Edmund follows Lucy and also enters Narnia. Upon arriving in
        Narnia, Edmund encounters the White Witch. When the Witch learns that
        Edmund is human and has siblings, she plies him with sweet Turkish
        Delight. The Witch promises to reward Edmund with more Turkish Delight
        if he brings his brother and sisters to her house. Upon returning to his
        own world, Edmund turns against Lucy and denies that he has been to
        Narnia. Peter and Susan chew him out and go to see the professor, who
        tells them that Lucy might not have been lying and he knows for a fact
        that she isn't crazy.

        Soon afterwards, all four children enter Narnia together while hiding in
        the wardrobe from the housekeeper, Mrs. Macready, who was giving a tour
        of the house. Lucy leads the group to Tumnus's home, only to find that
        it has been ransacked and that the faun has been arrested. The children
        are befriended by Mr. Beaver, a talking animal who takes them to his
        home. He informs the Pevensies that because of the Witch, it is always
        winter and never Christmas in Narnia. He and his wife tell the children
        about a prophecy that the Witch's tyranny will end when "two Sons of
        Adam and two Daughters of Eve" sit on the four thrones of Cair Paravel,
        and that Narnia's true ruler – the great lion Aslan – is returning from
        a long absence.
      </p>
      <p class="remove-bottom-margin">
        Edmund slips away to the Witch's castle. In the courtyard, he is
        surprised by the many statues of Narnians the Witch has turned to stone.
        The Witch greets him coldly, as he has come alone and with news that
        Aslan – her enemy – is returning. She takes Edmund prisoner and leaves
        her house to find and capture the other Pevensie children. Meanwhile,
        the Beavers – correctly surmising that Edmund has betrayed them – take
        the other children to meet Aslan at the Stone Table. As they travel,
        they find that the Witch's winter is giving way to spring. They are
        greeted by Father Christmas, who had been kept out of Narnia by the
        Witch's magic. The group arrive at their destination as winter ends and
        are greeted by Aslan. The Witch's enforcer, the wolf Maugrim, approaches
        the camp and attacks Susan, but is killed by Peter. Aslan sends a rescue
        party for Edmund; it arrives just in time to save him from the Witch,
        who had decided to kill him. 
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col">
      <p>
        The Witch parleys with Aslan, invoking the
        "Deep Magic from the Dawn of Time" which gives her the right to kill
        Edmund for his treason. Aslan denies her claim, but secretly trades his
        life for Edmund's.
        That evening, Susan and Lucy accompany Aslan to the Stone Table. They
        watch from a distance as the Witch puts Aslan to death. After the Witch
        and her followers depart to prepare for battle against Aslan's
        followers, Susan and Lucy remain with Aslan's body. In the morning, the
        girls find the Stone Table broken and Aslan restored to life. Aslan
        explains that the "Deeper Magic from before the Dawn of Time" has the
        power to reverse death if a willing victim takes the place of a traitor.
        Aslan takes the girls to the Witch's house and revives the Narnians that
        the Witch had turned to stone, including Tumnus and a giant named
        Rumblebuffin. They join the Narnian forces battling the Witch's army.
        The Narnian army prevails, and Aslan kills the Witch. The Pevensie
        children are then crowned kings and queens of Narnia at Cair Paravel.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a long and happy reign, the adult Pevensies go on a hunt for the
        White Stag who is said to grant the wishes of those who catch it. The
        four arrive at the lamppost and, having forgotten about it,
        unintentionally return through the wardrobe when they were looking for
        new adventures. When they return to England, they are children again,
        with no time having passed since their departure. They tell the story to
        the professor, who believes them and reassures the children that they
        will return to Narnia one day when they least expect it.

      <h2>Main characters</h2>
      <ul class="flex-container-column">

      <li>
          <h3>Lucy</h3>
          <p>
            is the youngest of four siblings. In some respects, she is the primary
            protagonist of the story. She is the first to discover the land of
            Narnia, which she enters inadvertently when she steps into a wardrobe
            while exploring the Professor's house. When Lucy tells her three
            siblings about Narnia, they do not believe her: Peter and Susan think
            she is just playing a game, while Edmund persistently ridicules her. In
            Narnia, she is crowned Queen Lucy the Valiant.
          </p>
      </li>

      <li>
          <h3>Edmund</h3>
          <p>
            is the second-youngest of four siblings. He has a bad relationship with
            his brother and sisters. Edmund is known to be a liar, and often
            harasses Lucy. Lured by the White Witch's promise of power and an
            unlimited supply of magical treats, Edmund betrays his siblings. He
            later repents and helps defeat the White Witch. He is eventually crowned
            King Edmund the Just.
          </p>
      </li>

      <li>
          <h3>Susan</h3>
          <p>
            is the second-oldest sibling. She does not believe in Narnia until she
            actually goes there. She and Lucy accompany Aslan on the journey to the
            Stone Table, where he allows the Witch to take his life in place of
            Edmund's. Tending to Aslan's carcass, she removes a muzzle from him to
            restore his dignity and oversees a horde of mice who gnaw away his
            bonds. She then shares the joy of his resurrection and the endeavor to
            bring reinforcements to a critical battle. Susan is crowned Queen Susan
            the Gentle.
          </p>
      </li>

      <li>
          <h3>Peter</h3>
          <p>
            is the eldest sibling. He judiciously settles disputes between his
            younger brother and sisters, often rebuking Edmund for his attitude.
            Peter also disbelieves Lucy's stories about Narnia until he sees it for
            himself. He is hailed as a hero for the slaying of Maugrim and for his
            command in the battle to overthrow the White Witch. He is crowned High
            King of Narnia and dubbed King Peter the Magnificent.
          </p>
      </li>

      <li>
          <h3>Aslan</h3>
          <p>
            a lion, is the rightful King of Narnia and other magic countries. He
            sacrifices himself to save Edmund, but is resurrected in time to aid the
            denizens of Narnia and the Pevensie children against the White Witch and
            her minions. As the "son of the Emperor beyond the sea" (an allusion to
            God the Father), Aslan is the all-powerful creator of Narnia. Lewis
            revealed that he wrote Aslan as a portrait, although not an allegorical
            portrait, of Christ.[7]
          </p>
      </li>

      <li>
          <h3>The White Witch</h3>
          <p>
            is the land's self-proclaimed queen and the primary antagonist of the
            story. Her spell on Narnia has made winter persist for a hundred years
            with no end in sight. When provoked, she turns creatures to stone with
            her wand. She fears the fulfillment of a prophecy that "two sons of Adam
            and two daughters of Eve" (meaning two male humans and two female
            humans) will supplant her. She is usually referred to as "the White
            Witch", or just "the Witch". Her actual name, "Jadis," appears once in
            the notice left on Tumnus's door after his arrest. Lewis later wrote a
            prequel to include her back story and account for her presence in the
            Narnian world.
          </p>
      </li>

      <li>
          <h3>The Professor</h3>
          <p>
            is a kindly old gentleman who takes the children in when they are
            evacuated from London. He is the first to believe that Lucy did indeed
            visit a land called Narnia. He tries to convince the others logically
            that she did not make it up. After the children return from Narnia, he
            assures them that they will return one day. The book hints that he knows
            more of Narnia than he lets on (hints expanded upon in later books of
            the series).
          </p>
      </li>

      <li>
          <h3>Tumnus</h3>
          <p>
            a faun, is the first individual Lucy (who calls him "Mr. Tumnus") meets
            in Narnia. Tumnus befriends Lucy, despite the White Witch's standing
            order to turn in any human he finds. He initially plans to obey the
            order but, after getting to like Lucy, he cannot bear to alert the
            Witch's forces. He instead escorts her back towards the safety of her
            own country. His good deed is later given away to the Witch by Edmund.
            The witch orders Tumnus arrested and turns him to stone, but he is later
            restored to life by Aslan.
          </p>
      </li>

      <li>
          <h3>Mr. and Mrs. Beaver</h3>
          <p>
            two beavers, are friends of Tumnus. They play host to Peter, Susan, and
            Lucy and lead them to Aslan.

      <h2>Writing</h2>
      <div class="clearfix">
        <div class="col">
      <p>
        <span class="bold">Lewis described the origin of </span> The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe in an
        essay titled "It All Began with a Picture":
      </p>


      <p>
        The Lion all began with a picture of a Faun carrying an umbrella and
        parcels in a snowy wood. This picture had been in my mind since I was
        about sixteen. Then one day, when I was about forty, I said to myself:
        'Let's try to make a story about it.' Shortly before the Second World
        War many children were evacuated from London to the English countryside
        to escape bomber attacks on London by Nazi Germany. On 2 September 1939
        three school girls, Margaret, Mary and Katherine, came to live at The
        Kilns in Risinghurst, Lewis's home three miles east of Oxford city
        centre. Lewis later suggested that the experience gave him a new
        appreciation of children and in late September he began a children's
        story on an odd sheet that has survived as part of another manuscript:
      </p>

      <p>
        This book is about four children whose names were Ann, Martin, Rose and
        Peter. But it is most about Peter who was the youngest. They all had to
        go away from London suddenly because of Air Raids, and because Father,
        who was in the Army, had gone off to the War and Mother was doing some
        kind of war work. They were sent to stay with a kind of relation of
        Mother's who was a very old professor who lived all by himself in the
        country.
      </p>
   
      <p>
        How much more of the story Lewis then wrote is uncertain. Roger Lancelyn
        Green thinks that he might even have completed it. In September 1947
        Lewis wrote in a letter about stories for children: "I have tried one
        myself but it was, by the unanimous verdict of my friends, so bad that I
        destroyed it."
      </p>

      <p>
        The plot element of entering a new world through the back of a wardrobe
        had certainly entered Lewis's mind by 1946, when he used it to describe
        his first encounter with really good poetry:
      </p>
      
      <p class="remove-bottom-margin">
        I did not in the least feel that I was getting in more quantity or
        better quality a pleasure I had already known. It was more as if a
        cupboard which one had hitherto valued as a place for hanging coats
        proved one day, when you opened the door, to lead to the garden of the
        Hesperides ...
      </p>
    </div>
      <div class="col">
      <p >
        In August 1948, during a visit by an American writer, Chad Walsh, Lewis
        talked vaguely about completing a children's book he had begun "in the
        tradition of E. Nesbit". After this conversation not much happened until
        the beginning of the next year. Then everything changed. In his essay
        "It All Began With a Picture" Lewis continues: "At first I had very
        little idea how the story would go. But then suddenly Aslan came
        bounding into it. I think I had been having a good many dreams of lions
        about that time. Apart from that, I don't know where the Lion came from
        or why he came. But once he was there, he pulled the whole story
        together, and soon he pulled the six other Narnian stories in after
        him."
      </p>

    <div class="center-content">
      <p>
        The major ideas of the book echo lines Lewis had written fourteen years
        earlier in his alliterative poem The Planets:
      </p>

      
        <blockquote>
            ... Of wrath ended And woes mended, of winter passed And guilt forgiven,
            and good fortune JOVE is master; and of jocund revel, Laughter of
            ladies. The lion-hearted ... are Jove's children.
        </blockquote>
      
    </div>
  

      <p>
        This resonance is a central component of the case, promoted chiefly by
        Oxford University scholar Michael Ward, for the seven Chronicles having
        been modelled upon the seven classical astrological planets, The Lion,
        the Witch and the Wardrobe upon Jupiter.
      </p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0rem;">
        On 10 March 1949 Roger Lancelyn Green dined with Lewis at Magdalen
        College. After the meal Lewis read two chapters from his new children's
        story to Green. Lewis asked Green's opinion of the tale and Green said
        that he thought it was good. The manuscript of The Lion, the Witch and
        the Wardrobe was complete by the end of March 1949. Lucy Barfield
        received it by the end of May. When on 16 October 1950 Geoffrey Bles in
        London published the first edition, three new "chronicles", Prince
        Caspian, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader and The Horse and His Boy, had
        also been completed.

        <h2>Illustration</h2>
        <div class="clearfix">
        <p style="margin-bottom: 7.5rem;">
          <span class="bold">Lewis's publisher, Geoffrey Bles</span>, allowed him to choose the illustrator for the novel and the Narnia series. Lewis chose Pauline Baynes, possibly based on J. R. R. Tolkien's recommendation. In December 1949, Bles showed Lewis the first drawings for the novel, and Lewis sent Baynes a note congratulating her, particularly on the level of detail. Lewis’s appreciation of the illustrations is evident in a letter he wrote to Baynes after The Last Battle won the Carnegie Medal for best children’s book of 1956: "is it not rather 'our' medal? I’m sure the illustrations were taken into account as well as the text".
        </p>
        <p>
            The British edition of the novel had 43 illustrations; American editions generally had fewer. The popular United States paperback edition published by Collier between 1970 and 1994, which sold many millions, had only 17 illustrations, many of them severely cropped from the originals, giving many readers in that country a very different experience when reading the novel. All the illustrations were restored for the 1994 worldwide HarperCollins edition, although these illustrations lacked the clarity of early printings.
